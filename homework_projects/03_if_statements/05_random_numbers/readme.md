# 🎲 Random Numbers Generator

## 📌 Overview
This Python program generates and prints **10 random numbers** in the range of **1 to 100**. Each time the program runs, it produces a different set of random numbers.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The program uses Python's built-in `random` module.
2. It generates **10 random integers** between **1 and 100**.
3. The numbers are printed in a single line, separated by spaces.

## ▶️ Running the Program
### Steps to Execute:
1. Ensure **Python 3.x** is installed on your system.
2. Save the script as `random_numbers.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the script’s directory.
4. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python random_numbers.py
   ```

## 💡 Example Output
```
45 79 61 47 52 10 16 83 19 12
```
```
81 76 70 1 27 63 96 100 32 92
```
Each time you run the program, you will get a different set of random numbers.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python **3.x**
- A terminal or command prompt to execute the script

## 🔖 Additional Notes
- The program uses the `random.randint(a, b)` function to generate random numbers, where `a` is the lower bound and `b` is the upper bound (both inclusive).
- The output format ensures numbers are printed in a clean and readable manner.
- You can modify the range or the number of random numbers as needed.
