# 📌 Print First 20 Even Numbers

## 📝 Description
This Python program prints the first 20 even numbers using a loop. Instead of writing 20 print statements manually, the program efficiently generates the numbers and prints them in a single execution.

## 🔥 Features
- Uses a loop to generate even numbers.
- Efficient and clean code implementation.
- Beginner-friendly example of loops in Python.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
Ensure Python is installed on your system.

### Running the Program
1. Save the script as `even_numbers.py`.
2. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python even_numbers.py
   ```
3. The program will print the first 20 even numbers.

### 🖥️ Example Output
```
0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38
```

## 📖 Notes
- The first even number is `0`.
- This example demonstrates how loops simplify repetitive tasks.
- You can modify the loop to generate more or fewer even numbers as needed.

Happy coding! 🚀
