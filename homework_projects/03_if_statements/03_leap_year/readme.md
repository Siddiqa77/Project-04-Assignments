# 📅 Leap Year Checker

## 📌 Overview
This Python program checks whether a given year is a leap year based on the Gregorian calendar rules. It helps users determine if a year has 366 days (leap year) or 365 days (common year).

## 🔍 How It Works
A year is classified as a **leap year** if it meets the following conditions:
✔ **Divisible by 4** → It might be a leap year.
✔ **Not divisible by 100** → Unless...
✔ **Divisible by 400** → Then it's a leap year!

Otherwise, the year is a **common year** with 365 days.

## ▶️ Running the Program
### Steps to Execute:
1. Ensure **Python 3.x** is installed on your system.
2. Save the script as `leap_year_checker.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the script’s location.
4. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python leap_year_checker.py
   ```
5. Enter a year when prompted, and the program will determine if it is a leap year.

## 💡 Example Output
```
Enter a year: 2024
That's a leap year! 🎉
```
```
Enter a year: 1900
That's not a leap year. ❌
```
```
Enter a year: 2000
That's a leap year! 🎉
```

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python **3.x**
- A terminal or command prompt to execute the script

## 🔖 Additional Notes
- The program assumes the user enters a valid numerical year.
- It strictly follows the **Gregorian calendar rules** for leap years.
- Useful for **calendar applications**, **date calculations**, and **historical research**.
