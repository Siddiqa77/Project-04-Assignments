# 🎢 Height Requirement Checker

## 📌 Overview
This Python program asks the user for their height and determines whether they meet the minimum height requirement for a ride. It continuously prompts the user for their height until they enter no input, at which point the program exits.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter their height.
2. If the height meets or exceeds **50 units**, they are allowed to ride.
3. If the height is below **50 units**, they are informed they are not tall enough.
4. The program keeps asking for height input until the user leaves it empty, at which point it stops.

## ▶️ Running the Program
### Steps to Execute:
1. Ensure **Python 3.x** is installed on your system.
2. Save the script as `height_checker.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the script’s directory.
4. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python height_checker.py
   ```
5. Enter your height when prompted.

## 💡 Example Output
```
How tall are you? 100
You're tall enough to ride!
```
```
How tall are you? 30
You're not tall enough to ride, but maybe next year!
```
```
How tall are you?
Goodbye!
```

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python **3.x**
- A terminal or command prompt to execute the script

## 🔖 Additional Notes
- The program assumes the user enters valid numerical input.
- If non-numeric input is entered, the user is prompted to enter a valid number.
- This can be extended to support different height units or ride types.
