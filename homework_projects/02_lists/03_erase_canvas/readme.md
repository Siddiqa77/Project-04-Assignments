# 🖌️ Eraser on Canvas

## 📌 Description
This Python program creates a grid-based canvas where an eraser tool can be used to erase blue cells by turning them white when dragged over them.

## 🔥 Features
- Creates a grid of blue cells using Pygame.
- Implements an eraser tool that changes cell colors to white upon contact.
- Mouse-based interaction for intuitive use.
- Simple, efficient rendering for smooth performance.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed:
```sh
pip install pygame
```

### Running the Program

### 🖥️ Example Usage
- Launch the program to see a blue canvas grid.
- Hold the left mouse button and drag the eraser to erase parts of the grid.

## 📖 Notes
- Uses Pygame's rectangle collision detection to erase cells.
- Great for learning about event handling and graphical rendering in Python.

Happy coding! 🚀
