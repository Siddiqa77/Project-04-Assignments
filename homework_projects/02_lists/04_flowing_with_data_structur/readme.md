# 🔄 Mutable List Demonstration

## 📌 Description
This Python program demonstrates how mutable data types like lists can be modified within functions without returning them. It takes user input and adds three copies of the entered message to a list.

## 🔥 Features
- Accepts user input for a message.
- Uses a helper function to add three copies of the message to a list.
- Demonstrates the concept of mutability in Python.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Running the Program
1. Save the script as `mutable_list_demo.py`.
2. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python mutable_list_demo.py
   ```
3. Enter a message when prompted.

### 🖥️ Example Output
```
Enter a message to copy: Hello world!
List before: []
List after: ['Hello world!', 'Hello world!', 'Hello world!']
```

## 📖 Notes
- Lists in Python are **mutable**, meaning changes persist outside functions.
- Unlike immutable types (e.g., numbers, strings), lists don't require returning to retain modifications.
- Useful concept when working with data structures in Python.

Happy coding! 🚀
