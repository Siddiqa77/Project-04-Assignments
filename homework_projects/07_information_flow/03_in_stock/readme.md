# 🍏 Sophia's Fruit Store - Stock Checker

## ✨ Description
This Python program helps check the availability of fruits in Sophia's store. The program prompts the user to enter a fruit name and returns the quantity available in stock. If the fruit is not in stock, it notifies the user accordingly.

## 🔧 How It Works
1. The user is prompted to enter the name of a fruit.
2. The `num_in_stock(fruit)` function checks if the fruit exists in the store's inventory.
3. If the fruit is available, the program prints the number of units in stock.
4. If the fruit is unavailable, the program informs the user that the fruit is not in stock.

## 📝 Sample Output
```
Enter a fruit: pear
This fruit is in stock! Here is how many:
1000
```
```
Enter a fruit: lychee
This fruit is not in stock.
```

1. Save the script as `fruit_stock_checker.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script using:
