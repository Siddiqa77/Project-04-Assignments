# 📝 Is Adult Checker

## 📌 Description
This Python program checks whether a person is legally an adult based on their age. The program follows the U.S. legal adult age of **18 years**.

## 🛠 How It Works
1. The `is_adult(age)` function:
   - Takes an integer **age** as input.
   - Returns `True` if the age is **greater than or equal to 18**.
   - Returns `False` otherwise.
2. The `main()` function:
   - Prompts the user to enter an age.
   - Calls `is_adult(age)` to determine if the person is an adult.
   - Prints `True` or `False` based on the result.

## 🖥 Sample Output
```
How old is this person?: 35
True
```
```
How old is this person?: 7
False
```

## ▶️ How to Run the Program
1. Save the script as `is_adult.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the script's directory.
4. Run the script using:
   ```
   python is_adult.py
   ```
5. Enter an age to check if it's 18 or older.

## 🔹 Features
✅ Uses **conditional statements** to determine adulthood.
✅ Provides **boolean output** (`True` or `False`).
✅ Beginner-friendly and easy to modify.

## 📋 Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## 🎯 Purpose
This program helps understand:
- **If-else statements** for decision-making.
- **Boolean values** (`True` or `False`).
- **User input handling** in Python.

Try entering different ages and see the results! 🚀😊
