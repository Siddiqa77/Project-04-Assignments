# 📝 User Data Signup

## 📌 Description
This Python program collects user information (first name, last name, and email address) through input prompts and returns the collected data as a tuple.

## 🛠 How It Works
1. The function `get_user_info()`:
   - Prompts the user for their **first name**.
   - Prompts the user for their **last name**.
   - Prompts the user for their **email address**.
   - Returns these values as a **tuple**.
2. The `main()` function:
   - Calls `get_user_info()`.
   - Prints the collected user data.

## 🖥 Sample Output
```
What is your first name?: Jane
What is your last name?: Stanford
What is your email address?: janestanford@stanford.edu
Received the following user data: ('Jane', 'Stanford', 'janestanford@stanford.edu')
```

## ▶️ How to Run the Program
1. Save the script as `user_data.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the script's directory.
4. Run the script using:
   ```
   python user_data.py
   ```
5. Enter the requested details.

## 🔹 Features
