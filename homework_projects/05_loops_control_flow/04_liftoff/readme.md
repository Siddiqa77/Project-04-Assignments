# 🚀 Spaceship Countdown

## 📌 Description
This Python program simulates the countdown for a spaceship launch. It counts down from 10 to 1 and then prints **"Liftoff!"** to signify a successful launch.

## 🛠 How It Works
1. The program uses a **for loop** to iterate from **10 down to 1**.
2. The countdown numbers are printed in a single line using `end=" "`.
3. After the countdown, the program prints **"Liftoff!"** to signal the launch.

## 🖥 Sample Run
```
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Liftoff!
```

## ▶️ How to Run the Program
1. Copy and paste the provided Python code into a `.py` file (e.g., `spaceship_countdown.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
4. Run the script using the command:
   ```
   python spaceship_countdown.py
   ```
5. The countdown will be displayed, followed by **"Liftoff!"**.

## 🔹 Features
✅ Simple and efficient countdown using a **for loop**.
✅ Uses `end=" "` to display output on a single line.
✅ Mimics a real spaceship launch countdown.

## 📋 Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## 🚀 Purpose
This program demonstrates the use of **loops** and **formatted output** in Python. It can be modified to include additional launch sequences or sound effects for a more immersive experience. Perfect for beginners learning Python loops! 😊

Enjoy coding and happy launching! 🚀🔥
