# Affirmation Checker

## 📌 Description
This Python program is designed to reinforce positive affirmations by prompting the user to type a predefined phrase correctly. The program ensures that the user enters the affirmation exactly as given before proceeding, reinforcing resilience and self-belief.

## 🛠 How It Works
1. The program defines an affirmation:
   **"I am capable of doing anything I put my mind to."**
2. It prompts the user to type the affirmation.
3. If the input matches the affirmation exactly, the program prints:
   **"That's right! :)"** and exits.
4. If the input is incorrect, the program displays:
   **"Hmmm That was not the affirmation. Please type the following affirmation:"**
   and prompts the user again.
5. The process continues until the user enters the affirmation correctly.

## 🖥 Sample Run
```
Please type the following affirmation: I am capable of doing anything I put my mind to.
Hmmm That was not the affirmation. Please type the following affirmation:
I am capable of doing anything I put my mind to.
That's right! :)
```

## ▶️ How to Run the Program
1. Copy and paste the provided Python code into a `.py` file (e.g., `affirmation_checker.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
4. Run the script using the command:
   ```
   python affirmation_checker.py
   ```
5. Follow the prompts to type the affirmation correctly.
