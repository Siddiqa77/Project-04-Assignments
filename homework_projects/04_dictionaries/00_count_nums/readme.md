# 🔢 Number Frequency Counter

## 📌 Overview
This Python program counts the number of times each number appears in a list provided by the user. It uses a **dictionary** to store and track occurrences of each number.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The program repeatedly asks the user to **enter a number**.
2. If the user presses **Enter without input**, the program stops asking for numbers.
3. The program stores the count of each number in a dictionary.
4. Once the input ends, it prints the frequency of each entered number.

## ▶️ Running the Program
### Steps to Execute:
1. Ensure **Python 3.x** is installed on your system.
2. Save the script as `number_frequency.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the script’s directory.
4. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python number_frequency.py
   ```
5. Enter numbers when prompted.

## 💡 Example Output
```
Enter a number: 3
Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: 3
Enter a number: 6
Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: 3
Enter a number: 12
Enter a number:
3 appears 3 times.
4 appears 2 times.
6 appears 1 time.
12 appears 1 time.
```

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python **3.x**
- A terminal or command prompt to execute the script

## 🔖 Additional Notes
- The program ensures **valid integer input**; if a non-integer is entered, the user is prompted again.
- The frequency of each number is stored efficiently using a **dictionary**.
- The program **dynamically updates** as numbers are entered, providing accurate frequency counts.
- Ideal for **basic data analysis** and learning about **dictionaries in Python**.
