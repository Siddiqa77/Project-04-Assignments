# 💡 Mass-Energy Equivalence Calculator

## 📌 Description
This program calculates energy based on mass using Einstein’s famous equation:

\[ E = m \times C^2 \]

where:
- \(E\) is the energy (joules)
- \(m\) is the mass (kilograms)
- \(C\) is the speed of light (299,792,458 m/s)

## 🔥 Features
- Continuously prompts the user for mass input.
- Computes energy using Einstein’s formula.
- Displays results clearly in a readable format.
- Handles invalid input gracefully.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### CLI Version
1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Save the script as `mass_energy.py`.
3. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python mass_energy.py
   ```
4. Enter mass values when prompted.

### 🖥️ Example Output
```
Enter kilos of mass: 100

e = m * C^2...

m = 100.0 kg
C = 299792458 m/s
8.987551787368176e+18 joules of energy!
```

## 📖 Notes
- The program runs in a loop, allowing multiple calculations.
- Enter a valid numeric mass value to avoid errors.
- Demonstrates basic physics and Python programming concepts.

Enjoy learning and coding! 🚀
