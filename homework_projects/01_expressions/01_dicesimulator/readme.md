# 🎲 Dice Roll Simulator

## 📌 Description
This project simulates rolling two dice three times and prints the results, showcasing variable scope in Python.

## 🔥 Features
- Uses Python's `random` module to generate random dice rolls.
- Rolls two dice three times and displays the sum of each roll.
- Demonstrates how variable scope works within functions.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### CLI Version
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Save the script as `app.py`.
3. Run the script using the command:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
4. The output will display three simulated dice rolls with their results.

### 🖥️ Example Output
```
Rolling dice...
Roll 1: 3 + 5 = 8
Roll 2: 2 + 6 = 8
Roll 3: 4 + 1 = 5
```

## 📖 Notes
- The CLI version runs directly in the terminal and generates random results.
- This project is a great way to understand random number generation and function scope in Python.

Enjoy coding and keep rolling! 🎲🚀
