# 🤖 Joke Bot

## 📌 Description
Joke Bot is a simple Python-based chatbot that responds only to one specific command: **"Joke"**. If the user types "Joke", the bot tells a humorous joke. Any other input results in a polite message stating that the bot only tells jokes.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The bot prompts the user with: **`What do you want?`**
2. The user enters their response.
3. If the user types **"Joke"**, the bot prints a funny joke.
4. If the user types anything else, the bot responds with: **`Sorry, I only tell jokes.`**

## 📌 Features
✅ Simple and easy to use 🤓
✅ Interactive text-based chatbot ✨
✅ Uses constants for better code readability 📜
✅ Can be expanded with more jokes in the future 🎭

## 📝 Constants Used
- **`PROMPT`** → The initial question displayed to the user.
- **`JOKE`** → The humorous joke provided when "Joke" is entered.
- **`SORRY`** → The polite response for invalid inputs.
