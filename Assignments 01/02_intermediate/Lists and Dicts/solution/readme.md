# List Practice & Index Game

## Overview
This project contains two Python exercises:
1. **List Practice** - Basic list operations such as length checking, adding elements, and printing.
2. **Index Game** - An interactive game to practice accessing, modifying, and slicing elements in a list.

## Features
### List Practice
- Initializes a list of fruits.
- Prints the length of the list.
- Appends a new fruit to the list.
- Displays the updated list.

### Index Game
- Prompts the user to choose an operation:
  1. Access an element by index.
  2. Modify an element at a given index.
  3. Slice the list between two indices.
  4. Exit the game.
- Handles index out-of-range errors gracefully.
- Provides real-time feedback with updated lists.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python list_practice_game.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to interact with the game.

## Example Run
```
Choose an operation:
1. Access an element
2. Modify an element
3. Slice the list
4. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter the index to access: 2
Element: green
```

## Future Enhancements
- Add validation for non-integer inputs.
- Introduce random list generation for more variety.
- Implement a graphical interface (GUI) for better user experience.

Enjoy practicing lists in Python! ðŸš€
