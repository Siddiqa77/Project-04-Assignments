# Countdown Timer

## Overview
The Countdown Timer is a simple Python script that counts down from a user-specified number of seconds and displays the remaining time in minutes and seconds.

## How to Use
1. Run the script using Python.
2. Enter the number of seconds for the countdown.
3. The timer will update every second, showing the remaining time.
4. Once the countdown reaches zero, it displays "Time's up!"

## Running the Timer
Ensure you have Python installed, then run the script:
```sh
python countdown_timer.py
```

## Example Run
```
Enter countdown time in seconds: 10
00:10
00:09

...
Time's up!
```

## Future Enhancements

- Allow user to pause and resume the timer.
- Play a sound when the countdown ends.
