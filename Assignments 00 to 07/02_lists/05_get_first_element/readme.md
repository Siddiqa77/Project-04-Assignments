# 📌 Get First Element from a List

## 📝 Description
This Python program prompts the user to input a list and then prints the first element from the list. It demonstrates how to access list elements in Python.

## 🔥 Features
- Accepts user input to create a list.
- Retrieves and prints the first element.
- Ensures the list is non-empty before accessing elements.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Running the Program
1. Save the script as `get_first_element.py`.
2. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python get_first_element.py
   ```
3. Enter the number of elements followed by the elements themselves.

### 🖥️ Example Output
```
Enter the number of elements in the list: 3
Enter element 1: Apple
Enter element 2: Banana
Enter element 3: Cherry
First element: Apple
```

## 📖 Notes
- Lists are **zero-indexed**, meaning the first element is accessed with `lst[0]`.
- This function assumes the list will never be empty, as per the problem statement.

Happy coding! 🚀
