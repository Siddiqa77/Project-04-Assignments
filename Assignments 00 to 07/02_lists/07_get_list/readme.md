# 📌 Collect User Inputs into a List

## 📝 Description
This Python program continuously prompts the user for input values and stores them in a list. The input collection stops when the user presses Enter without typing anything, at which point the list is displayed.

## 🔥 Features
- Allows the user to enter multiple values dynamically.
- Stores all entered values in a list.
- Stops taking inputs when the user presses Enter without typing.
- Displays the final list to the user.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Running the Program
1. Save the script as `collect_user_inputs.py`.
2. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python collect_user_inputs.py
   ```
3. Enter values one by one, pressing Enter after each.
4. To stop, simply press Enter without typing anything.

### 🖥️ Example Output
```
Enter a value: Apple
Enter a value: Banana
Enter a value: Cherry
Enter a value:
Here's the list: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry']
```

## 📖 Notes
- The program takes user input as **strings** and stores them in a list.
- If you want to work with numerical data, consider type conversion using `int()` or `float()`.

Happy coding! 🚀
