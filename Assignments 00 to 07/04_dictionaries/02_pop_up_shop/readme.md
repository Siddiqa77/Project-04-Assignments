# 🍎 Fruit Shop Calculator

## 📌 Overview
This Python program helps users calculate the total cost of purchasing different types of fruits. Users can specify how many of each fruit they want, and the program computes the total cost based on predefined prices.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The program contains a **dictionary of fruit prices**.
2. It prompts the user to **enter the quantity** of each fruit they want to buy.
3. If the user enters an invalid input (like a negative number or non-numeric value), the program prompts them again.
4. Once all inputs are collected, the program **calculates and displays the total cost**.

## ▶️ Running the Program
### Steps to Execute:
1. Ensure **Python 3.x** is installed on your system.
2. Save the script as `fruit_shop.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the script’s directory.
4. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python fruit_shop.py
   ```
5. Follow the prompts to enter fruit quantities.

## 💡 Example Output
```
How many (apple) do you want?: 2
How many (durian) do you want?: 0
How many (jackfruit) do you want?: 1
How many (kiwi) do you want?: 0
How many (rambutan) do you want?: 1
How many (mango) do you want?: 3

Your total is $99.50
```

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python **3.x**
- A terminal or command prompt to execute the script

## 🔖 Additional Notes
- The program ensures **valid integer input** to prevent errors.
- The total cost is displayed **with two decimal places** for accuracy.
- The program can be **extended to include more fruits or different pricing models**.
