# 📖 Phonebook Program

## 📌 Overview
This Python program demonstrates the use of **dictionaries** to manage a simple **phonebook**. Users can **add, search, delete, and display contacts** stored in the phonebook.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The program provides a **menu-driven interface** for managing contacts.
2. Users can **add a contact** by entering a name and phone number.
3. Users can **search for a contact** by name.
4. Users can **delete a contact** from the phonebook.
5. Users can **display all contacts** stored in the phonebook.
6. The program **loops until the user chooses to exit**.

## ▶️ Running the Program
### Steps to Execute:
1. Ensure **Python 3.x** is installed on your system.
2. Save the script as `phonebook.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the script’s directory.
4. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python phonebook.py
   ```
5. Follow the menu instructions to manage contacts.

## 💡 Example Output
```
Phonebook Menu:
1. Add Contact
2. Search Contact
3. Delete Contact
4. Display All Contacts
5. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter name: Alice
Enter phone number: 123456789

Exiting Phonebook. Goodbye!
```

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python **3.x**
- A terminal or command prompt to execute the script

## 🔖 Additional Notes
- The phonebook is stored in **memory (dictionary)** and does not persist after the program exits.
- The program ensures **basic input validation** and **error handling**.
- It can be **extended to store contacts in a file or database**.
