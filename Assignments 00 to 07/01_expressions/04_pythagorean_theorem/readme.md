# 📐 Pythagorean Theorem Calculator

## 📌 Description
This Python program calculates the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle using the **Pythagorean theorem**:

\[ c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \]

where:
- \( a \) and \( b \) are the perpendicular sides.
- \( c \) is the hypotenuse.

## 🔥 Features
- Asks the user for two perpendicular side lengths.
- Uses the Pythagorean theorem to compute the hypotenuse.
- Handles invalid input with error messages.
- Runs in a loop for multiple calculations.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### CLI Version
1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Save the script as `pythagorean.py`.
3. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python pythagorean.py
   ```
4. Enter the side lengths when prompted.

### 🖥️ Example Output
```
Enter the length of AB: 3
Enter the length of AC: 4

The length of BC (the hypotenuse) is: 5.0
```

## 📖 Notes
- Enter valid numeric values for accurate results.
- Demonstrates basic geometry and Python programming concepts.

Happy coding! 🚀
