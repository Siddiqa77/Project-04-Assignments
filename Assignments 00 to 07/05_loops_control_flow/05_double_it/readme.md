# 🔢 Double Until 100

## 📌 Description
This Python program asks the user to enter a number, then continuously doubles that number and prints the result until the value reaches or exceeds **100**.

## 🛠 How It Works
1. The user is prompted to enter a starting number.
2. The program maintains the **current number** in a variable called `curr_value`.
3. A **while loop** runs as long as `curr_value` is less than **100**.
4. The value is doubled and printed in a single line.
5. The loop stops when the doubled value reaches or exceeds **100**.

## 🖥 Sample Run
```
Enter a number: 2
4 8 16 32 64 128
```

## ▶️ How to Run the Program
1. Copy and paste the provided Python code into a `.py` file (e.g., `double_until_100.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
4. Run the script using the command:
   ```
   python double_until_100.py
   ```
5. Enter a number and observe the output.

## 🔹 Features
✅ Uses a **while loop** for continuous doubling.
✅ Displays output in a **single line** for better readability.
✅ Dynamically stops when the value **reaches or exceeds 100**.

## 📋 Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## 🚀 Purpose
This program helps understand **looping structures** and **variable manipulation** in Python. It demonstrates **real-time updates** of a variable inside a loop, making it a great exercise for beginners!

Enjoy coding! 🚀😊
