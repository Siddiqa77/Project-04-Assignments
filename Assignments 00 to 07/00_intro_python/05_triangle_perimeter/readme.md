# 🔺 Triangle Perimeter Calculator

## 📖 About This Program
This Python program is designed to calculate the **perimeter of a triangle** by taking the lengths of its three sides as user input and summing them up.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to **enter the lengths of three sides** of a triangle.
2. It converts the input values into **floating-point numbers** to ensure precision.
3. The perimeter is calculated using the formula:
   
   ```
   perimeter = side1 + side2 + side3
   ```
   
4. The **final perimeter value** is then displayed as output.

## 📌 Example Execution
```
What is the length of side 1? 3
What is the length of side 2? 4
What is the length of side 3? 5.5
The perimeter of the triangle is 12.5
```

## 🛠️ Key Features
✅ **Interactive Input:** Uses `input()` to collect side lengths from the user.
✅ **Precision Handling:** Converts values to `float` to avoid integer limitations.
✅ **Accurate Calculation:** Performs a direct sum of all three sides.
✅ **User-Friendly Output:** Displays the computed perimeter in an easy-to-read format.

## 🎉 Try It Yourself!
Run this script in any Python environment, input the side lengths, and instantly compute the **perimeter of any triangle**!
