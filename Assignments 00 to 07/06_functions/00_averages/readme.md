# 📊 Average Calculator

## 📌 Description
This Python program defines a function that calculates the **average** (midpoint) between two given numbers. The function is then used to compute intermediate averages, demonstrating how nested averaging works.

## 🛠 How It Works
1. The function `average(a, b)` computes the midpoint between two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula:
   ```python
   (a + b) / 2
   ```
2. The `main()` function calculates the average of **two sets** of numbers:
   - `avg_1 = average(0, 10)`
   - `avg_2 = average(8, 10)`
3. It then finds the **final average** between `avg_1` and `avg_2`.
4. The results are printed to the console.

## 🖥 Sample Run
```
avg_1: 5.0
avg_2: 9.0
final: 7.0
```

## ▶️ How to Run the Program
1. Copy and paste the provided Python code into a `.py` file (e.g., `average_calculator.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
4. Run the script using the command:
   ```
   python average_calculator.py
   ```
5. Observe the calculated averages printed on the screen.

## 🔹 Features
✅ Simple function to calculate the **midpoint** between two numbers.
✅ Demonstrates **nested averaging** to refine results.
✅ Uses **floating-point division** for precision.

## 📋 Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## 🎯 Purpose
This program helps in understanding:
- **Function definition and usage**
- **Mathematical operations in Python**
- **How averaging works in a step-by-step manner**

Enjoy coding! 🚀😊
