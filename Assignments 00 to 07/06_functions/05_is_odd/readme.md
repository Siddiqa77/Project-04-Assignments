# 📝 Even-Odd Checker

## 📌 Description
This Python program iterates through numbers from **10 to 19** and prints whether each number is **even** or **odd**.

## 🛠 How It Works
1. The function `is_odd(value)` determines if a number is **odd**.
2. The `main()` function:
   - Loops through numbers **10 to 19**.
   - Calls `is_odd()` to check if a number is odd.
   - Prints the number followed by "even" or "odd".

## 🖥 Sample Output
```
10 even
11 odd
12 even
13 odd
14 even
15 odd
16 even
17 odd
18 even
19 odd
```

## ▶️ How to Run the Program
1. Save the script as `even_odd_checker.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the script's directory.
4. Run the script using:
   ```
   python even_odd_checker.py
   ```
5. The program will print numbers from **10 to 19** along with their even/odd status.

## 🔹 Features
✅ Demonstrates **loops and conditional statements**.
✅ Uses **modulo operator** to check even and odd numbers.
✅ Beginner-friendly and easy to modify.

## 📋 Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## 🎯 Purpose
This program helps understand:
- **For loops** and iteration.
- **Modulo operations** for checking even and odd numbers.
- **Function calls** and return values in Python.

Modify the range to check different numbers and experiment with the logic! 🚀😊
