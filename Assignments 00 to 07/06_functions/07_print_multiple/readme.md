# 📝 Print Multiple Times

## 📌 Description
This Python program takes a **message** and a **number** from the user and prints the message that many times.

## 🛠 How It Works
1. The `print_multiple(message, repeats)` function:
   - Loops **repeats** times.
   - Prints the given **message** each time.
2. The `main()` function:
   - Asks the user for a message.
   - Asks how many times to repeat it.
   - Calls `print_multiple(message, repeats)`.

## 🖥 Sample Output
