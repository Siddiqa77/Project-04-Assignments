# 📝 Print Divisors

## 📌 Description
This Python program prints all the divisors of a given number. A **divisor** of a number is any integer that divides the number with no remainder.

## 🛠 How It Works
1. The function `print_divisors(num)`:
   - Loops through numbers from **1 to num**.
   - Checks if `num` is **divisible** by the current number.
   - If so, prints the divisor.
2. The `main()` function:
   - Asks the user to enter a number.
   - Calls `print_divisors(num)` to display its divisors.

## 🖥 Sample Output
```
Enter a number: 12
Here are the divisors of 12
1
2
3
4
6
12
```

## ▶️ How to Run the Program
1. Save the script as `print_divisors.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the script's directory.
4. Run the script using:
   ```
   python print_divisors.py
   ```
5. Enter a number and view its divisors.

## 🔹 Features
✅ Uses **loops and conditionals** to determine divisors.
✅ Provides **user-friendly input and output**.
✅ Beginner-friendly and easy to modify.

## 📋 Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## 🎯 Purpose
This program helps understand:
- **For loops** and iteration.
- **Modulo operator (%)** for checking divisibility.
- **User input handling** in Python.
