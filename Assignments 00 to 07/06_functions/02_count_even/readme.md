# 🔢 Count Even Numbers

## 📌 Description
This Python program takes a list of integers from user input and counts the number of even numbers in the list.

## 🛠 How It Works
1. The function `get_list_of_ints()` prompts the user to enter integers until they press **Enter** to stop.
2. The function `count_even(lst)` iterates through the list and counts the number of even numbers.
3. The `main()` function calls both functions and prints the result.

## 🖥 Sample Run
```
Enter an integer or press enter to stop: 3
Enter an integer or press enter to stop: 6
Enter an integer or press enter to stop: 9
Enter an integer or press enter to stop: 12
Enter an integer or press enter to stop:
2
```
(There are **2** even numbers: 6 and 12)

## ▶️ How to Run the Program
1. Copy the Python script into a `.py` file (e.g., `count_even_numbers.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the script's directory.
4. Run the script using:
   ```
   python count_even_numbers.py
   ```
5. Enter integers when prompted and press **Enter** to stop input.
6. The program will print the count of even numbers.

## 🔹 Features
✅ Uses **user input** to create a dynamic list.
✅ Uses **list comprehension** for counting even numbers efficiently.
✅ Implements a **while loop** to accept user input dynamically.

## 📋 Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## 🎯 Purpose
This program helps understand:
- **Loops and conditionals** in Python.
- **User input handling**.
- **List operations** (appending and iterating).

Try it out and count the even numbers in your custom list! 🚀😊
