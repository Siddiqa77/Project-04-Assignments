# High-Low Game

## Overview
The **High-Low Game** is a simple Python game where the player competes against the computer in multiple rounds by guessing whether their randomly generated number is higher or lower than the computerâ€™s number.

## How to Play
1. The game starts by displaying a welcome message.
2. Each round:
   - The player is given a random number (1-100).
   - The computer also gets a random number (1-100) but it is hidden from the player.
   - The player guesses if their number is **higher** or **lower** than the computerâ€™s.
   - If the guess is correct, they earn a point; otherwise, they donâ€™t.
   - The computerâ€™s number is revealed after each round.
   - The playerâ€™s score is displayed.
3. The game continues for a set number of rounds (default: 5).
4. After all rounds, the final score is displayed along with a performance message:
   - **Perfect score:** "Wow! You played perfectly!"
   - **Half or more rounds correct:** "Good job, you played really well!"
   - **Less than half correct:** "Better luck next time!"

## Features
