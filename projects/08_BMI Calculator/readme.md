# BMI Calculator

## Overview
The BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator is a Python script that calculates a user's BMI based on their weight and height and categorizes them accordingly.

## Features
- Takes user input for weight (kg) and height (meters).
- Calculates the BMI using the formula: `BMI = weight / (height^2)`.
- Categorizes the BMI as:
  - Underweight (<18.5)
  - Normal weight (18.5 - 24.9)
  - Overweight (25 - 29.9)
  - Obese (30 and above)

## How to Use
1. Run the script using Python.
2. Enter your weight in kilograms.
3. Enter your height in meters.
4. The script calculates and displays your BMI along with your category.

## Running the Script
Ensure you have Python installed, then run the script:
```sh
python bmi_calculator.py
```

## Example Run
```
Enter your weight in kg: 70
Enter your height in meters: 1.75
Your BMI is: 22.86

```

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for height in feet and inches.
