# Guess the Number - Computer Guesses

## Overview
This version of "Guess the Number" flips the game: instead of the player guessing the number, the computer tries to guess the player's chosen number. The player provides feedback after each guess, guiding the computer until it finds the correct number.

## Features
- The player picks a secret number between 1 and 100.
- The computer makes a guess and the player responds with "higher", "lower", or "correct".
- The computer adjusts its guess based on the player's feedback.
- The game continues until the correct number is found.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python guess_the_number_computer.py
   ```
3. Think of a number between 1 and 100.
4. Respond to the computerâ€™s guesses with "higher", "lower", or "correct".

## Example Run
```
Think of a number between 1 and 100, and I'll try to guess it!
Is it 50? (higher/lower/correct): higher
Is it 75? (higher/lower/correct): lower
Is it 62? (higher/lower/correct): correct
I guessed your number in 3 attempts!
```

## Future Enhancements
- Allow different number ranges.
- Implement an AI that optimizes guessing strategies.
- Add a mode where the computer cheats for fun.
