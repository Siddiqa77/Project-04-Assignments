# Guess the Number - User Guesses

## Overview
This version of "Guess the Number" is a simple game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number chosen by the computer. The game provides hints after each guess, letting the player know if their guess is too high or too low until they find the correct number.

## Features
- The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- The player enters guesses and receives feedback ("too high", "too low", or "correct").
- Tracks the number of attempts.
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python guess_the_number.py
   ```
3. Enter your guesses when prompted.
4. Continue guessing until you find the correct number.

## Example Run
```
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
Enter your guess (between 1 and 100): 50
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess (between 1 and 100): 25
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess (between 1 and 100): 37
Congratulations! You guessed the number 37 in 3 attempts.
```

## Future Enhancements
- Add difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) with different number ranges.
- Implement a scoring system based on the number of attempts.
- Allow multiple rounds of play.
