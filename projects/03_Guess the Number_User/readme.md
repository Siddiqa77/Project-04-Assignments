# Guess the Number (User Guesses)

## Overview
This is a simple Python game where the computer selects a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it. The program provides feedback to help the user guess the correct number.

## How It Works
1. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
2. The user enters their guess.
3. The program responds with:
   - "Too low! Try again." if the guess is lower than the secret number.
   - "Too high! Try again." if the guess is higher than the secret number.
   - "Congratulations!" if the guess is correct.
4. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## How to Run the Program
1. Clone this repository or copy the script.
2. Run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python guess_number.py
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Example Output
```
I have chosen a number between 1 and 100. Try to guess it!
